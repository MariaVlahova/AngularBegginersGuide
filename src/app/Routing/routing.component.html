  Simple step for routing
  1.create a module app-routing.module.ts if you don`t have delete everything in routes array  and add add the new rout like a JSON object with two properties
  path(path from /) and component (component name). You could user RoutingComponent as an example (will be redirect to /rout)
  3.Use the path with routerlink where you need it and add router-outler component if you want to work properly  .For example app.component.html
